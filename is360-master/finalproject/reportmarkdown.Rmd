#**Intro**
<br>
This is a report using R rmarkddown, of the final project from is 360 classs. 
This report is based on the airquality package, and then I added a couple of variables to make it a wider data. First I calculated the real feel sensation of tempertaure, the way the weather channels and weather scientific do it, they calculate their reports based on mathematical formulas, I needed to create a new variable in order to calcualte the real feel sensation.
I added the variable Windchill temperature and then the resultant variable RealFeel.


To calculate the Windchill temperature we needed to know the atmospheric temperature and the air speed, both of this we got it from the original aiquality package. Here is the formula how to calculate the windchill:

<br>

###**Equation for Windchill:** 

T{wc}=13.12 + 0.6215 T_a-11.37 V^{+0.16} + 0.3965 T_a V^{+0.16}

Twc = Wind Chill Temperature, Ta = Atmospheric Temperature (F), and V = Air Speed (mph) (Source).

Also we can get accurate and hourly windchill temperature from this graph, by updating the requied values onto the formula.

To calcualte  the apparent temperature of also called the Real feel temperature we used the following formula:

<br>

##**Equation to find the appararent temperature:**

the formula for the AT is: AT=T_a+0.348*e-0.70*ws+0.70\frac{Q}{ws+10}-4.25

Ta = Dry bulb temperature (°C) 
e = Water vapour pressure (hPa) [humidity] 
ws = Wind speed (m/s) at an elevation of 10 meters 
Q = Net radiation absorbed per unit area of body surface (w/m2) 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
require(ggplot2)
library(weatherData)
require(weatherData)
```

<br>

That was pretty much I had to do to deal with an updated and personalized airquality data

###**Now, the next part of the project, Exporting data from R studio to Postgresql**

*THE TABLE DATA IS THE TABLE FROM TAKEN FROM THE AIRQUALITY PACKAGE FROM R, I EXPORTED THAT DATA TO POSTGRESQL, THE DATA ON THE TABLE DATA WOULD REPRESENT
THE DATA FROM THE WHOLE NY STATE FROM MAY TO 2014-05 TO 2014-09, I added the columns date personally to match the date on the table MANHATTAN . ( the data on the airquality package on r its not really a ny data but i wanted to use it like it really was)

**THE TABLE DATAINCELSIUS IS EXACTLY THE SAME THAT THE TABLE DATA BUT ALL CONVERTED PREVIOUSLY ON R STUDIO TO CELIUS. 

***THE TABLE MANHATTAN IS THE TABLE I OBTAINED THROUGHT R STUDIO THROUGH FETCHING DATA ONLINE FROM WEATHER STATIONS, USING THE R PACKAGE "weatherDATA" 

http://ram-n.github.io/weatherData/

I first imported the fetched weather data from the months 2014-05 to 2014-10, but only from the station located on MANHATTAN, I used the following code thanks to the
library(weatherDATA)

Manhattandata = getWeatherForDate("MANHATTAN", "2014-05-05", "2014-10-05")

that imported the required data from the station MANHATTAN to my R studio file, then I again exported that data to a postgresql table called Manhattan.

***My idea was to compare how the "fictionary" weather data from the whole NY state placed on the table "DATA" compares to the weather data obtain from only Manhattan.
I know I could have had it thought way better and more organized but time was limited.

..

Viewing the data from the tables exported to postgresql


```{r}
summary(RoundCelsius)
summary(Manhattan)
summary(data)
```

<br>

###**Then we can started to plot our information:**


First plot for the REal FEel monthly report:

```{r}

ggplot(airquality1, aes(x=RealFeel)) +
geom_bar(width =.3)
```

<br>

###**Now plotting RoundCelsius table**


```{r}

ggplot(RoundCelsius, aes(x=Temp)) +
geom_bar(width =.3)
```

<br>


###**Now plotting Manhattan table**


```{r}

ggplot(Manhattan, aes(x=Mean_TemperatureC)) +
geom_bar(width =.3)
```


##**Finally:**
After I was done with both tables, the next step was to export it all to .csv files , for later have it all import it to the database "nyweather" on postgresql. 
The database I created on postgresql was called "nyweather" and as mentioned at the beginning of this presentation it have two main tables ,"data" and "Manhattan", and also a third alternative table called "dataincelsius" that was just basically the same data on the table "data" but converted to Celsius. 
After I populate my tables I was ready to do various basic and complex queries. All these queries are showed on detail on the folder for my final project on my github:
